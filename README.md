# PowerFlowmodel.pdf
This is a PDF file which states the optimization problem clearly. 

# Optimization
This is an implementation with python package Pyomo. 

Since Gurobi is not available for me, I modified the the Thermal limit. Instead of contrainting its $$\ell_2$$-norm, I constrainted its $$ell_1$$-norm.

# Attention

The original problem in the PDF is a MINLP problem which can not be solved by GLPK. 

# Package
Pyomo 6.8.2
GLPSOL: GLPK LP/MIP Solver, v4.65
